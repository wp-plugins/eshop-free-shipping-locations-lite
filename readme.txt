== Description ==

eShop supports free shipping after a certain value. This add-on allows the user to specify a State/County/Province to which shipping is not charged.

This "Lite" version is quite limited, as only a single location can be set. 

A more robust version will be launched soon at [UseStrict Consulting](http://usestrict.net).
